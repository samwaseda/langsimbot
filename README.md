# LangSimBot

This is basically the Telegram version of [LangSim](https://github.com/jan-janssen/langsim).

You can talk to [langsimbot](https://t.me/langsimbot) if you have Telegram. Currently it's mostly offline to avoid misuse, but you can personally talk to me if you want to test it.

Commands

- `/start`: Start a conversation
- `/clear`: Clear the conversation

As a matter of fact, `/start` and `/clear` have the same effect (at least for now).
